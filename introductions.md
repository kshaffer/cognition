*video introduction – to be added*

Welcome! As you're gearing up for the course, please be sure to examine the [syllabus](/syllabus/) and [course policies](/policies/) carefully. Once you've done so and watched the above video, please do the following **by 3 p.m. (MDT) on Monday, June 1:**

1. **Make your own personal introduction video.** This is a 1-minute video of yourself in which you give us your name as you'd like us to call you, and either what you find most interesting about this course or what you'd most like to learn in this course, and upload it to the course discussion forum. (*instructional video for uploading a video to be added*)

2. **Sign up for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) (if you don't already have an account), and then send a tweet to me with the course hashtag.** Something like, "Hey, @krisshaffer, I'm getting set up for the summer #muscog course!" The course hashtag will help others in the course find you, and tagging me will let me know to follow you (so you can send me private messages) and add you to my list for the course. I'll re-tweet your message to make sure others in the course see it (since new Twitter users don't always show up in hashtag search results for a while). You are welcome to use a pseudonym in your Twitter account, but if so, please [send me an email](mailto:kris.shaffer@colorado.edu) to let me know your pseudonym.

3. Go to the discussion forum on our class D2L page. **Watch a few (or all!) of your colleagues' videos, and leave a friendly comment on at least two of them** in response to something they shared in their video. (*instructional video to be added*)

These three things are an easy way to get **your first three assessment points**, but more importantly, they will help us build a collaborative, mutually beneficial community for this course. Once you've gotten started with the above, try to find/follow them on Twitter by searching for "#muscog".

Note: We will be using both public and private online fora for class discussions. Because things posted online disappear far more slowly than things that are spoken (if they ever disappear), and since typed text lacks the nuances of body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, it is even more important to take care in promoting an environment of openness and respect. Please review the "professional courtesy" section on my [course policies](/policies/) document, and commit to doing your part to foster an environment where intellectual challenges are welcome, but always put forward with the utmost respect.
