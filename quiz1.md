Following are the questions for Quiz 1. Keep them in mind as you do the readings and watch the videos, discuss them with each other, and then take the quiz in D2L before the deadline.

Keep in mind the collaborative nature of the D2L quizzes. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.

## Questions

1. Define musical meter.

2. Define musical pitch.

3. Define echoic memory.

4. What is the difference between major and (natural) minor scales?

5. Define simple meter.

6. Define compound meter.

7. Define recognition.

8. Define recollection.

9. What is one problem with Snyder's organization of music (events, melodic/rhythmic patterns, large-scale form) according to three modes of temporal processing (echoic, short-term, long-term memory)?

10. Snyder places a threshold for melodic patterns/large-scale form at the same point that he places a threshold for short-term/long-term memory. However, he places a threshold for events/melodic patterns at a different place than he places a threshold for echoic and short-term memory. Why do those thresholds differ? (event/melodic pattern v. echoic/long-term memory)
