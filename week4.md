## Unit introduction

What is a piece of music that really grips you? What is it about that piece, that moment that floors you every time you hear it? And why is it that we can keep coming back to the same songs, albums, artists without getting bored? Surely we find some music boring, and other music less interesting than the first time we heard it. But think about it. How many times have you seen your favorite movie? And how many times have you listened to your favorite song? What is this seemingly indefatigable power that some music seems to have over us?

This week we will explore the connection between music perception and cognition and human emotion — the cognitive functions and the biological structures that generate our emotional responses to music, and the musical structures and grammars that take advantage of them.

## Assignments

For **Monday, June 22, 11:59pm MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take [Quiz 7](/quiz7/) on D2L:

- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 1, "Introduction"  
- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 2, "Surprise"  
- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 3, "Measuring musical expectation"  
- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 4, "Auditory learning"  
- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 5, "Statistical properties of music"  

For **Wednesday, June 28, 8am MDT,** submit a draft contract for the final project. See the [Week 5 Guide](/week5/) for information on the final project. (If you do not think you will meet the threshold required to submit a final A-level project, there is no need to submit a contract proposal. Simply focus on your work for this week, and begin to make plans for reassessments during Week 5. If you have any question about whether or not you will meet the threshold, please contact me.)

For **Wednesday, June 28, 8am MDT,** submit votes for your colleagues' core concept videos from Week 3 on D2L. For at least two of the concepts, leave a substantive, positive comment under the video that you like best for each concept. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for further details.

For **Wednesday, June 24, 8am MDT,** submit three written explanations of the relationship between two different core concepts on our emerging [concept map](https://prezi.com/ntsoqg1f9m7i/music-cognition/). These relationships should each involve at least one concept from Week 3. (Connections between two Week 3 concepts, or between one Week 3 concept and one Week 2 concept are both fair game.) See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details on the expectations and collaborative opportunities for this assignment.

For **Wednesday, June 24, 11:59pm MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take [Quiz 8](/quiz8/) on D2L:

- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 9, "Tonality"  
- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 13, "Form"  

For **Friday, June 26, 8am MDT,** submit two core concept videos on concepts *from the Week 3 or Week 4 lists.* See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.
