## Unit introduction

What is a piece of music that really grips you? What is it about that piece, that moment that floors you every time you hear it? And why is it that we can keep coming back to the same songs, albums, artists without getting bored? Surely we find some music boring, and other music less interesting than the first time we heard it. But think about it. How many times have you seen your favorite movie? And how many times have you listened to your favorite song? What is this seemingly indefatigable power that some music seems to have over us?

This week we will explore the connection between music perception and cognition and human emotion — the cognitive functions and the biological structures that generate our emotional responses to music, and the musical structures and grammars that take advantage of them.

For **Wednesday, June 22, 7am MDT,** submit a draft contract for the final project. See the [Week 5 Guide](/week5/) for information on the final project. (If you do not think you will meet the threshold required to submit a final A-level project, there is no need to submit a contract proposal.

For **Wednesday, June 22, 7am MDT,** submit three written explanations of the relationship between two different core concepts on our emerging concept map(link forthcoming). These relationships should each involve at least one concept from Week 3. (Connections between two Week 3 concepts, or between one Week 3 concept and one Week 2 concept are both fair game.) See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details on the expectations and collaborative opportunities for this assignment.

For **Wednesday, June 22, 7am MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take **Quiz 8** on D2L:

- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 13, "Form"  

For **Friday, June 24, 7am MDT,** submit two core concept videos on concepts *from the Week 3 or Week 4 lists.* See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.

For **Friday, June 24, 7am MDT,** submit two core concept paragraphs on concepts *from the Week 3 or Week 4 lists.* See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.

For **Friday, June 24, 7am MDT,** submit a revised contract for the final project, based on the feedback you received on yoiur draft contract. See the [Week 5 Guide](/week5/) for information on the final project.
