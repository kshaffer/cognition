## Schedule

**Tuesday, June 30 (due 8am MDT):** video votes due  
**Wednesday, July 1 (due 8am MDT):** concept map contributions due  
**Friday, June 26 (due 8am MDT):** final projects and reassessments due


## Assignments

For **Tuesday, June 23, 8am MDT,** submit votes for your colleagues' core concept videos from Week 3 on D2L. For at least two of the concepts, leave a substantive, positive comment under the video that you like best for each concept. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for further details.

For **Wednesday, June 24, 8am MDT,** submit two written explanations of the relationship between two different core concepts on our emerging [concept map]() (link forthcoming). These relationships should each involve at least one concept from Week 2. (Connections between two Week 2 concepts, or between one Week 2 concept and one Week 1 concept are both fair game.) See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details on the expectations and collaborative opportunities for this assignment.


## Final projects and reassessments

*From the syllabus & assessment guide:*

If you wish to obtain an A in the class, you will construct a final project that applies course concepts in a domain not discussed in class, or critiques some presentation of material in class. You and I will negotiate the details of these projects one-on-one, with the goals of 1) finding a project in line with your interests, 2) adding to public human knowledge/understanding, and 3) moving beyond the memorization, understanding, and synthesis of course concepts into the realm of application and critique. Shortly after midterm, you will have an opportunity to propose project ideas, and our negotiations will be completed before the beginning of Week 5, with a clear contract of expectations laid out. You may only pursue the final project if you have met the appropriate threshold (see below).

Students must have earned 37 points by the beginning of Week 5 (Monday, June 29) in order to pursue a final project. *Collaboration permitted if approved by the instructor in the contract for the project.* Since they are due on the last day of class, there is no reassessment opportunity, but the contract should make the grade clear to students when they submit.

*Video explanation to be added.*

*Sample project contract to be added.*

Students who do not qualify for the final project may submit up to 5 points worth of new or reattempted videos and/or concept map contributions during the final week. *No collaboration allowed, no further reassessments allowed.*

All final projects and reassessments are due by **8am, Friday July 3.**

## Learning objectives

This unit is directed towards the following student goals:

- ability to synthesize and apply the core concepts listed above, individually or in collaboration with others, in a written explanation  
- ability to articulate an accurate definition and at least one example of application about the core concepts in one's own words (reassessments)  
- contribute to public understanding of the relationship between music and cognitive science  
- ability to construct and articulate substantive, manageable goals (final project)  
- ability to self-assess progress towards those goals (final project)
