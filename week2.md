## Unit introduction

Is music really a "universal language"? This is a common claim from both musicians and music lovers — but is it true? In this unit, we will begin to unpack which aspects of human musical practice are innate/evolved and which are learned. We will also explore small-scale cognitive functions like short-term and working memory, and their implications for human music.

*video to be added*

## Core concepts

In this unit, we will explore the following new core concepts. These *and the concepts from [Unit 1](/week1/)* are possible topics for your core concept videos (see below):

- short-term memory
