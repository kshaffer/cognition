## Unit introduction

What is a musical note? a chord? rhythm? Do musicians define these differently than cognitive scientists? What exactly do we *hear* when we listen to music?

We will engage these and other related questions during this unit, as we begin to explore the workings of the human auditory system and basic musical concepts.

*video to be added*

## Core concepts

In this unit, we will explore the following core concepts:

- (musical) events
