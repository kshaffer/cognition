Following are the questions for Quiz 4. Keep them in mind as you do the readings and watch the videos, discuss them with each other, and then take the quiz in D2L before the deadline.

Keep in mind the collaborative nature of the D2L quizzes. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.

## Questions

1. Which form of memory is time-ordered? (echoic, short-term, long-term)

2. Define priming.

3. Define working memory.

4. Which has the smallest information-processing capacity? (echoic, short-term, long-term)

5. Define melody (according to Snyder).

6. When is a pitch maximally out-of-tune?

7. What problem arises from a scale made entirely of equal intervals?

8. The first phrase of "Hide and Seek" by Imogen Heap is 9 seconds long ([https://open.spotify.com/track/6eRJfzCaPjbkTQ0gvPMLsi](https://open.spotify.com/track/6eRJfzCaPjbkTQ0gvPMLsi) – embedded below). Snyder says that phrases should be within the limits of short-term memory storage (3–5 seconds). What about this phrase, or the music to follow, mitigates the potential negative effect of this conflict, making this a perfectly cognizable phrase?  

9. Find a song/piece of music that contains an example of closure where at least three different musical parameters (pitch height, rhythmic activity, dynamics/volume, instrumentation, etc.) decrease in intensity. Provide the artist, title, a link (Spotify preferable, YouTube is okay) and the timing of the moment of closure.

10. Find a song/piece of music with an example of what musicians call a "compound melody": a single voice or instrument that is alternating between notes that belong to two different streams. Provide the artist, title, a link (Spotify preferable, YouTube is okay) and the timing of the moment of compound melody. (See Snyder, p. 144, for a discussion of streams, and be sure to make use of the forum/Twitter for this one. I recommend looking into solo violin music (like the Bach Partitas), fiddle music, or bagpipe music.)
