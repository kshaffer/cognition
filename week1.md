## Unit introduction

What is a musical note? a chord? rhythm? Do musicians define these differently than cognitive scientists? What exactly do we *hear* when we listen to music?

We will engage these and other related questions during this unit, as we begin to explore the workings of the human auditory system and basic musical concepts.

## Core concepts

In this unit, we will explore the following core concepts:

- (musical) events  
- pitch  
- echoic memory  
- primitive auditory grouping  
- learned auditory grouping  
- habituation  
- musical meter  
- musical keys  

## Assignments

For **Monday, June 1, 3pm MDT,** complete the introductory activities. See [Getting started](/introductions/) for details.

On **Tuesday, June 2, 11am MDT,** we will have our first video office hours. A link to the chat is [here](https://cuboulder.zoom.us/j/431750257) (password is provided on D2L). This is the prime opportunity for some (if not all) of us to discuss things live, as a group. We will use Zoom, a video conferencing app supported by CU's Office of Information Technology. Please visit OIT's [Zoom support page](http://www.colorado.edu/oit/services/conferencing-services/web-conferencing-zoom) for information on setting up your account and downloading the software. There are both desktop and mobile versions. (It is possible to participate via phone instead of the app. See OIT's instructions, and contact me if you need help.)

For **Wednesday, June 3, 3pm MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take [Quiz 1](/quiz1/) on D2L:

- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 1, "Auditory Memory: an Overview"  
- *Open Music Theory*, ["Meter"](http://openmusictheory.com/meter.html)  
- Video: ["Meter, part 1: counting pulse"](https://vimeo.com/127952221)  
- Video: ["Meter, part 2: grouping & division"](https://vimeo.com/127955738)  
- Video: ["Major keys & scales"](https://vimeo.com/94802632)  
- Video: ["Minor scales & keys"](https://vimeo.com/94803688)  
- *Open Music Theory*, ["Pitches"](http://openmusictheory.com/pitches.html)
