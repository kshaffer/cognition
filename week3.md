## Unit introduction

When a new song comes on the radio, how quickly do you know if you want to keep listening? The "scan" function on a car radio changes stations every couple of seconds, but for most people, that is more time than they need to know that they want to keep moving and try something else. In fact, most people can discern a musical genre in a fraction of a second — sometimes before they hear the singer sing a complete word! And certainly before they've heard an entire musical phrase, or become oriented to the key and the meter. Why is that?

This week we will explore the nature of musical styles and genres, and the cognitive functions that allow us to build a robust implicit understanding of musical styles and to recognize and judge them quickly. We will also explore the nature of musical expertise. Just what makes a musical expert? Are only trained musicians experts?



## Core concepts

- long-term memory  
- implicit (procedural) memory  
- episodic memory  
- semantic memory  
- feature extraction  
- perceptual binding  
- perceptual categories  
- conceptual categories  
- schemata  
- nuance  
- difference between recall & recognition  
- interference  
- cueing  
- priming  

## Assignments

For **Monday, June 15, 11:59pm MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take [Quiz 5](/quiz5/) on D2L:

- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 6, "Long-term memory"  
- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 7, "Categories"  
- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 12, "Rhythm"  

For **Wednesday, June 17, 8am MDT,** submit votes for your colleagues' core concept videos from Week 2 on D2L. For at least two of the concepts, leave a substantive, positive comment under the video that you like best for each concept. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for further details. (These will be posted before the weekend.)

For **Wednesday, June 17, 8am MDT,** submit three written explanations of the relationship between two different core concepts on our emerging [concept map](https://prezi.com/ntsoqg1f9m7i/music-cognition/). These relationships should each involve at least one concept from Week 2. (Connections between two Week 2 concepts, or between one Week 2 concept and one Week 1 concept are both fair game.) See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details on the expectations and collaborative opportunities for this assignment.

For **Wednesday, June 17, 11:59pm MDT,** please read/watch the following and then take [Quiz 6](/quiz6/) on D2L:

- *Music and Memory*, Chapter 8, "Schemas"  
- *Sweet Anticipation*, Chapter 11, "Genres, schemas, firewalls"  
- Robert O. Gjerdingen, ["Defining Schemata"](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9o4hmKNoi6caHZNakRXTktScU0/view?usp=sharing) (from *Music in the Galant Style*)  
- Kris Shaffer, ["Style and Tendency"](http://openmusictheory.com/tendency.html), from *Open Music Theory* (feel free to skim through the discussion of voice-leading rules)  
- Allan F. Moore, [quote on the distinction between style and genre](http://sketches.shaffermusic.com/2015/on-the-distinction-between-style-and-genre-popmusicevolution), from "Categorical Conventions in Music Discourse: Style and Genre"  
- Robert O. Gjerdingen & David Perrott, ["Scanning the dial: The rapid recognition of music genres"](http://faculty-web.at.northwestern.edu/music/gjerdingen/Papers/PubPapers/Scanning.pdf)  

For **Friday, June 19, 8am MDT,** submit **three** core concept videos on concepts *from the Week 3 list only (see above).* Be sure to keep them **under two minutes** in duration, and to include **an example of musical application.** See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details. If you need to reassess any video submissions from Week 2, please include them with your new videos for Week 3. (Keep in mind that only assignments that were submitted to begin with will be considered for a reassessment.)

## Learning objectives

This unit is directed towards the following student goals:

- ability to recognize, recall, and/or find basic information about the core concepts listed above  
- ability to synthesize and apply the core concepts listed above, individually or in collaboration with others, in a written explanation  
- ability to articulate an accurate definition and at least one example of application about the core concepts from Week 3 in one's own words  
- contribute to public understanding of the relationship between music and cognitive science
