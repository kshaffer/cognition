Following are the questions for Quiz 2. Keep them in mind as you do the readings and watch the videos, discuss them with each other, and then take the quiz in D2L before the deadline.

Keep in mind the collaborative nature of the D2L quizzes. See the [Assignment guide](/assessments/) for details.

## Questions

1. Define bottom-up/data-driven processing. (In your definition, include its purpose and whether it is primarily evolved or learned.)

2. Define top-down/memory-driven/schema-driven processing. (In your definition, include its purpose and whether it is primarily evolved or learned.)

3. Define grouping.

4. How many elements can comprise a musical phrase.

5. What are noises?

6. In cognitive/perceptual terms, what is the difference between rhythm and melody?

7. What kind of memory is used to distinguish pitch difference in two immediately successive musical tones?

8. Repetition enhances chunkability, and therefore memorability. Repetition also enables habituation, and therefore reduced listener attention, which in turn inhibits memorability. How, then, can a musician facilitate memorability of their music?

9. Provide an example of a single musical phrase (give a link to audio on Spotify, preferably, or video on YouTube/Vimeo, along with start/end timings). What specific features of coherence and closure make that passage a single phrase? Use terms from Gestalt psychology where applicable.

10. Provide an example of a musical culture. Name at least three musical traits or practices that are common in that tradition, but uncommon in others.

## Learning objectives
